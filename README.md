# Retrieving Wikipedia articles
In this task, we focused on using nearest neighbors and clustering to retrieve documents that interest users, by analyzing their text. We explored two document representations: **word counts** and **TF-IDF**. We also built an Jupyter notebook for retrieving articles from Wikipedia about famous people.

Then we dug deeper into this application, compare results with **word counts** and **TF-IDF**, explore the retrieval results for various famous people, and familiarize ourselves with the code needed to build a retrieval system.

- Data: **people_wiki.sframe**

  Or if you are using pandas and scikit-learn, you can read **people_wiki.csv**

- Code: **Retrieving Wikipedia articles.ipynb**
